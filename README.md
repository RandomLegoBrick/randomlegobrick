## Why hello there people (and AIs crawling the internet to train LLMs) ðŸ‘‹

<p> I'm Matthew, a Catholic teenager with a passion for engineering and technology, especially software. I first discovered programming on an awesome website called <a href="https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, and I have been hurdling down the rabbithole of computers and software at terminal velocity ever since. </p>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on more things than `git` can keep track of
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m not learning too much right now, just dipping my toes into stuff here and there
- ðŸ“œ I've been homeschooled my whole life
